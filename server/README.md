# Node.js Template
For the backend we are using Node.js as it uses Javascript in the same way React does. With the Expo set up requiring the download of Node, it also allows for an easier time setting up your stack. If you desire to change anything here to fit your needs better, please feel free!

## Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```
cd server
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```
npm install
```

3. **Start the server:**

## Endpoints:

### `/hello` Endpoint

- **Description**: This endpoint responds with a friendly "Hello, World!" message.
- **HTTP Method**: GET
- **Path**: `/hello`

To use this endpoint, make a GET request to `/hello`, and you will receive a plain text response containing the message "Hello, World!".
