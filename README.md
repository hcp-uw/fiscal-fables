# React Native + Node Template
Created by Rasmus Makiniemi, curated by the Tech Team

## Background
React Native is an open-source JavaScript framework that allows you to build mobile apps using the same codebase, enabling you to write code once and deploy it across different platforms, such as iOS, Android, and Windows.

React Native is one of the leading mobile development frameworks, and is used by countless companies which you can find out more [about here](https://reactnative.dev/showcase).

## The Template
This template uses Expo to seemlessly bridge the gap between developing on a computer to displaying on a mobile device. With the use of the Expo Go app on your phone and a simple one line command in your terminal, Expo generates a QR code for you to scan in the app to open your project on a phone.

As Expo automatically sends updates to the app on your phone, you can continuously keep coding and see the updates in real-time.

## Getting Started
For this project, you need two things installed, Expo Go on your phone and Node.js on your computer which you can find the downloads to here:

- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Once you are done with that, start following the steps listed in the README's in the `client` and `server` folders to set up and run the front-end and backend respectively.

Happy coding!
